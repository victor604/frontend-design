**Transform bland UIs into bold, memorable experiences.** An AI agent skill that brings professional design thinking to every web interface.

## 🎨 What is This?

This skill helps AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.) transform generic web UIs into distinctive, production-grade interfaces with:

- **Bold aesthetic directions** - No more generic purple gradients
- **Distinctive typography** - Avoiding Inter/Roboto/Arial
- **Memorable color systems** - Context-appropriate palettes
- **Creative layouts** - Breaking the grid with purpose
- **Smooth animations** - One orchestrated moment > many micro-interactions
- **Production-ready code** - Not just pretty, but functional

## ✨ Features

✅ Screenshot analysis with design recommendations  
✅ 15+ aesthetic directions (Neo-Brutalist, Editorial, Glassmorphism, etc.)  
✅ Typography mastery with font psychology  
✅ Advanced color theory & mood boards  
✅ Layout techniques (asymmetric, diagonal, overlap)  
✅ Animation patterns library (CSS + Framer Motion)  
✅ Complete transformation examples  
✅ Accessibility-first approach  
✅ Mobile-responsive patterns

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Screenshot Transformation

```
You: [Upload screenshot of generic landing page]
"This is my SaaS landing page. Make it memorable and bold."

Claude: I'll transform this into a Neo-Brutalist design with:
- Bebas Neue + Space Mono fonts
- Bold black/yellow/cyan color scheme
- Thick borders with shadow extrusion
- Asymmetric layout with diagonal flow

[Provides complete, production-ready HTML/CSS]
```

### Scenario 2: Building from Scratch

```
You: "Create a portfolio homepage for a creative developer"

Claude: Based on your creative context, I recommend an Editorial Luxury direction:
- Playfair Display + Lora fonts
- Black/white with one accent color
- Asymmetric two-column layout
- Large typography with generous whitespace
- Subtle hover animations

[Implements complete design]
```

### Scenario 3: Dashboard Design

```
You: "Design a modern analytics dashboard"

Claude: Let's use Glassmorphism for a contemporary feel:
- Gradient mesh background
- Frosted glass cards with backdrop-filter
- Outfit font family
- Smooth transitions and hover states

[Creates full dashboard with interactive elements]
```
